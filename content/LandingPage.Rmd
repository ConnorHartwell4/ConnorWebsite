# Welcome to my Website!

My name is Connor Hartwell and I am an assistant coach at the University of Charleston. I am a former student-athlete who captained the team to two regular season titles and two conference tournament trophies.

I am looking to eventually become a head coach in the college soccer realm once I graduate with my second masters. I currently have an undergraduate degree in sport business and a master of science in strategic leadership, and I am now undertaking another masters in business and data analytics.
